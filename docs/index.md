# About

The objective of **Sco-Edge** project is the design and implementation of *Service Continuity-Oriented Software Framework* for orchestrating *Edge Continuum,* a heterogeneous cloud computing platform that spans hyperscale clouds, edge clouds, and edge devices.

The main research topics of this project include:

* Collaborative computing across hyperscale clouds, edge clouds, and edge devices
* Workload profiling-based system optimization for edge-native applications
* Data plane visibility-driven resource management for edge-cloud infrastructure
* Low-latency machine learning edge inference system
* Design and implementation of predictable, configurable, and interoperable SW framework for edge-cloud

Sco-Edge is an 8-year (2023-2030) research project being conducted by NetLab at Korea University, which is designated as an *SW StarLab* by Institute of Information and Communication Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP), funded by the Korean government.
