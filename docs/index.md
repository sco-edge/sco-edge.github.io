# About

Welcome to the homepage of Service Continuity-Oriented Edge Continuum SW Framework.

It is an 8-year (2023-2030) research project being conducted by NetLab at Korea University, designated as an *IITP SW StarLab* by the government of Republic of Korea.

This project is aimed at the research and development of service continuity-oriented SW framework for orchestrating edge continuum, a heterogeneous cloud computing platform which spans hyperscale clouds, edge clouds, and edge devices.

The main research topics of this project include:

* Collaborative computing across hyperscale clouds, edge clouds, and edge devices
* Workload profiling-based system optimization for edge-native applications
* Data plane visibility-driven resource management for edge-cloud infrastructure
* Low-latency machine learning edge inference system
* Design and implementation of predictable, configurable, and interoperable SW framework for edge-cloud
